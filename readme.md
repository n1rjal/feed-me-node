## Feed me node
Feed me node is a free self-hosted messaging/transport platform. We can host run the project in any desired path.

## Planning
Here are some of the plans that I am tying to implement with feed-me-node package. Plans includes
1. Implement server with NestJS processing the messages
2. Implement server for various transports like [SSE](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/server-sent-events), [Websockets](https://github.com/websockets/ws)
3. I am trying to implement various messaging platforms like 
      - AWS SES
      - Sendgrid
      - Twilio SMS
      - Custom Platform

## Config File
This self hosted server will gain all its configuration/settings from a yaml file so that. It can setup various services.
